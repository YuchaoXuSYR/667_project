# 667_project
The project for CIS667, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

# Requirements
Python 3.x<br/>
Numpy
Pytorch

# Pattern
There four roles that can be chosen: player, baseline AI, tree-based AI and tree-NN based AI. The user can assign any one of these role to player1 and player2 respectively.

# How ro run
If you want to play with our already trained models, you can just run:<br/>
**python main.py**<br/><br/>
If you want to train your own model, you can conduct your own training data by:<br/>
**python data.py**<br/>
(The data file could be very big.)<br/><br/>
Then simply run:<br/>
**python neural_network.py**<br/><br/>
Finally you got your own models. Each board size will have a model.<br/>
