# 667_project
The project for CIS667, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

# Requirements
Python 3.x<br/>
Numpy
Pytorch

# Pattern
There four roles that can be chosen: player, baseline AI, tree-based AI and tree-NN based AI. The user can assign any one of these role to player1 and player2 respectively.

# How ro run
If you want to play with our already trained models, you can just run:
python main.py

If you want to train your own model, you can conduct your own training data by:
python data.py
(The data file could be very big.)
Then simply run:
python neural_network.py
Finally you got your own models. Each board size will have a model.
